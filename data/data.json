      "name": "The Great Depression",
      "description": "Artists working in the Federal Arts Project and for other Works Progress Administration agencies created prints, easel paintings, drawings, and photographs. Public murals were painted for display in post offices, schools, airports, housing developments, and other government buildings. Community art centers hosted exhibitions of work made by artists employed in government programs and offered hands-on workshops, led by artists, for everyone. Illustrators made detailed drawings that cataloged the physical culture and artifacts of American daily life - clothing, tools, household items. The WPA intentionally seeded arts programs and supported artists outside of urban centers. In so doing, it introduced the arts to a much more diverse swath of Americans, many of whom had previously never seen an original painting or work of art, had not met a professional artist, nor experimented with art making.",

      "name": "Skyscrapers Around the World",
      "description": "This exhibit examines contemporary works of art that take as their subject the form, technology, myth, message, and image of that iconic building structure: the skyscraper. While the exhibition has particular relevance to Chicago - the city that is widely known as the birthplace of this architectural type - artists throughout the world, in addition to authors, filmmakers, poets, and undoubtedly architects, have been enthralled by the human desire to build farther and farther into the sky, testing technological limits while embodying a yearning for spiritual connection to the heavens.",
